In the game, the player can move their ship left and right using the A and D keys respectively, and they can shoot down the enemies and asteroids trying to destroy the player ship, with each obstacle destroyed adding to the player's score. If the player collides with an obstacle, the player ship is destroyed, and the game must be restarted to play again.
